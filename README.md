# Anero Project
*A Research-Focused Privacy Cryptocurrency based on CryptoNote*

## Overview
The **Anero Project** is an experimental cryptocurrency built on the **CryptoNote** protocol family. Inspired by The Monero Project, Anero explores:

- enhanced transaction privacy
- novel approaches to metadata obfuscation
- experimental network-governed rollout

Unlike many fully decentralized privacy coins, Anero’s early-stage design includes **centralized coordination** to support controlled research, security auditing, and phased development.

Anero’s mission is to **research** and **evolve** privacy-preserving digital cash in a way that is transparent, documented, and academically valuable.

## Key Goals

- **Stronger Anonymity Sets**  
  Exploration of ring size strategies, decoy selection algorithms, and timing obfuscation.

- **Security-Focused Parameters**  
  Emphasis on rigorous threat modeling and mitigations against network analysis.

- **Phased Deployment**  
  Controlled rollout allows measured, auditable improvements.

## Centralized Liquidity Phase (Research Stage)

During its first phase, Anero may interoperate with **external third-party platforms** for liquidity research.

This enables:

- measurement of privacy behavior under controlled conditions
- simplified economic benchmarking
- isolation of early vulnerabilities

This model is used to evaluate how coordinated infrastructure affects:

- anonymity sets
- transaction timing resistance
- graph analysis integrity

> **Anero does not operate, manage, endorse, or affiliate with any marketplace, exchange, or external platform.**  
> Any third-party adoption is unsolicited and outside project control.
